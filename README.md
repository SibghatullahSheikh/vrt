##About

####This is a web application that is still under development.

I started building this javascript based data visualization web application some years ago (2-3 years). I cannot finish it alone, the whole project has basically just been a struggle. This stuff is difficult to do in javascript, so most of the time i have used to make things more efficient.

I've written a similar application in C#/.Net in 3-4 months.

It is supposed to be an application that can run standalone as a Chrome App and also together with nodejs. The nodejs process would then send and receive data out to client. But it should also be able to load data...

It started out as a work project, but with too high ambitions i am unable to complete it. I am not employed as a full time programmer.

There has been a lot of changes over the years, I tried out different visualization libraries and ended up experimenting with WebGL for drawing.

I will happily support anyone interested in learning more / contributing.
